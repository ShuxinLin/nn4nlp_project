west indian all-rounder phil simmons took four for reg_digitz on friday as leicestershire beat somerset by an innings and reg_digitz runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals essex , derbyshire and surrey all closed in on victory while kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against nottinghamshire . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
after bowling somerset out for reg_digitz on the opening morning at grace road , leicestershire extended their first innings by reg_digitz runs before being bowled out for reg_digitz with england discard andy caddick taking three for reg_digitz . <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
trailing by reg_digitz , somerset got a solid start to their second innings before simmons stepped in to bundle them out for reg_digitz . <PAD> <EOS>
essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after nasser hussain and peter such gave them a firm grip on their match against yorkshire at headingley . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
hussain , considered surplus to england 's one-day requirements , struck reg_digitz , his first championship century of the season , as essex reached reg_digitz and took a first innings lead of reg_digitz . <PAD> <EOS>
by the close yorkshire had turned that into a reg_digitz-run advantage but off-spinner such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for reg_digitz in reg_digitz balls and leaving them hanging on reg_digitz for five and praying for rain . <PAD> <EOS>
at the oval , surrey captain chris lewis , another man dumped by england , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for reg_digitz on thursday with reg_digitz not out on friday in the match against warwickshire . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
he was well backed by england hopeful mark butcher who made reg_digitz as surrey closed on reg_digitz for seven , a lead of reg_digitz . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since reg_digitz by reducing worcestershire to reg_digitz for five in their second innings , still reg_digitz runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . <PAD> <EOS>
australian tom moody took six for reg_digitz but chris adams , reg_digitz , and tim o'gorman , reg_digitz , took derbyshire to reg_digitz and a first innings lead of reg_digitz . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
after the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , kent stepped up a gear to dismiss nottinghamshire for reg_digitz . <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
they were held up by a gritty reg_digitz from paul johnson but ex-england fast bowler martin mccague took four for reg_digitz . <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <EOS>
by stumps kent had reached reg_digitz for three . <PAD> <EOS>
